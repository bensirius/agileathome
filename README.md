Agile software processes for other things


# History of programming and open source
Many of the techniques developed to manage software projects can be used in many different environments. The combination of art and engineering that is required to build larger software projects necessitated a whole new way of working. The massively collaborative, decentralised techniques that evolved to build open source projects involving thousands of developers and no managers may require a few tools, but those tools can be used for many purposes now that they have been created. Before learning the processes born in software engineering, it is worth getting an understanding of where and why they evolved. 

# Impact Mapping
One of the simplest and most immediately applicable methodologies used in agile software is the impact map. It distills a number of different techniques into a clear and understandable mind-mapping process. Impact mapping is a tool for used to get all project stakeholders to fit their needs and objectives together, in a simple and visual way. It introduces the ideas of measurement, personas, user stories and MVP - without needing to understand any of them. 

# Personas and user centered design
Building on the initial impact mapping process, we dig into the idea of grouping together the various project stakeholders into personas. Personas allow us to teach people to frame their projects and objectives in terms of real world outcomes. Any project can benefit from having a way to describe the different interest groups, factions or "tribes" that may be involved as personas. 

User centered design is a way of defining projects in terms of what people need to get out, rather than what goes in. It can be applied in many different spheres, and provides one of the key foundations of destribiuted management. 

# Lean 
The lean methodologies did not actually arise from software development, but they have been dramatically enhanced and publicised due to their adoption by the software start-up community. The key ideas behind the lean methodologies encourage people to approach their objectives by clearly defining their assumptions about what might work, and then finding the simplest way to test those assumptions - the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Lean is an approach that encourages fast failure and rapid learning. The lean approach allows projects to grow with the smallest possible investment, and the best long term term odds for success. The lean techniques attempt to make success more of a science than an art. 

# User stories and acceptance criteria
One of the most popular tools of the agile software trade is the "User Story". User stories encourage project objectives to be defined in terms of what someone (a user) may want to achieve. Projects get mapped out in lots of index cards pinned to a wall, arranged to tell the stories of how users (personas) might go about certain tasks. Each element of a project is captured in a simple statement - and then discussed in detail. 

One of the key elements to user stories is that they decentralise the decision making process. The stories do not prescribe how something should be done, instead they are extended to define their acceptance criteria - a definition of what success looks like. It is then up to the individual responsible for implementing the story to actually work out the details. 

#Test first and metrics
Understanding what success looks like is made even more powerful when it is possible to associate metrics and some kind of test with the end result. Forcing someone to think about how they would test whether or not their work is effective is a very valuable process and can be applied in all sorts of situations. It may be easier in some circumstances, but, there should always be some way in which you can tell whether or not a project has been successful. 

# Scrum, Kanban and sprints - the iterative development process
With an understanding of personas, MVP, and Stories we can look into the way they are used in day to day operations. The use of story cards on a wall to create a board, daily standing meetings and the roles in a team are adaptable to many differnt situations. 

Scrum and Kanban have some different focusses, but both of them work in short iterations. Stories are assigned points to get an idea of size and complexity, prioritised and then worked on in order. There is no fixed set of stories that will be completed within a set iteration - with the next iteration beginning with the reprioritisation and adjustment of the stories based on the experience of the last cycle. 

These processes really do work best when they don't involve any technology. Cards arranged in columns on a wall turn out to be more effective that any software tool. Scrum and Kanban have no project managers, they require multidisciplanry teams without heirarchy to work best. They empower individual members of a team to work in their own style, but also require the establishment of common practices and standards - valuable in any environment. 

# Roadmaps
Software always has so many possible outcomes, anything is possible. Most software projects could be extended forever, with all sorts of distractions along the way. In order to involve as many people in the fleshing out of the long range vision of a project, roadmaps are used to gather and share the possible routes a project can take. 

Roadmapping is a very useful process of any organisation. It is inclusive, but allows for focus and prioritsation of tasks by placing options within a bigger context. Roadmaps build on user stories, but allow them to get bigger and look further into the future. 

# Version control
Perhaps the most influential tool to come out of software development is concurrent, distributed version control. version control tools allow thousands of developers to work effectively on the source code for a single project. 

For an organisation to grow beyond it's founders, and operate in a decentralised way, it's processes and operational rules need to be written down. (This is the essence of the franchise process.) Once written down, these texts are the organisation's source code. They are the programme that the organisation runs - and the best tool for managing this "software" is version control. 

When key documents are managed in a version control system, indivuduals are empowered to suggest changes - without worrying if they are "important enough" to make the changes - an issue that effects wikis and other collabrative editing tools. The processes of branching and merging are very powerful organisational tools, if matched with a basic process that allows changes to be voted in. 

When "organisational source code" is stored in an online tool like github.com, it becomes possible for other organisations to Fork this foundation, and build new organisations based on the same foundations - the idea of open source. 

Version control is one of those processes that is really only made possible by specific tools. The tools have evolved from very technical origins, but new online sites like github provide an accessible way to apply them. 

# Process mapping
Although version control is a very effective tool to manage operational processes, the method by wich these processes are captured is an altogether different story that goes far beyond software engineering - but programming techniques can help here too. 

Applying the user story mapping process, and lean techniques, it is possible to map known organisational processes and to identify the next steps. We are able to bring together all a number of different techniques, and show how the various elements of an organisation can be documented in a manner that would allow significantly increased levels of individual empowerment and decentralisation.
